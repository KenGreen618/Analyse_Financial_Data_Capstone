## import data
- use yf for this 
- pick SECTOR ETF'S


## calculate financial statistics
- returns over different time frames
- risk - variance, std dev
- correlations
- covariance


## optimise portfolio
- mean-variance portfolio optimisation
  - shows the efficient frontier of the stocks selected
- how a risky investor should allocate
- how a safe investor should allocate
- show multiple investment options at different risk levels and specify the returns
